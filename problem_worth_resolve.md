Problems worth resolving 

1. Arrays
>* Easy
>    * 169 Majority Element : Solve with using O(1) extra space.
>* Medium
>    * 1314 Matrix Block Sum : Prefix sum with 2D array
>    * 56 Merge Intervals : Not sorted input & take care of all cases
>    * 152 Maximum Product Subarray : Solve with binary search. 
>    * 334 Increasing Triplet Subsequence
>    * 347 Top K Frequent Elements : The idea of bucket sort.
>    * 435 Non-overlapping Intervals : Sorting intervals. 
>    * 526 Beautiful Arrangement
>    * 1014 Best Sightseeing Pair
>* Hard
>    * 239 Sliding Window Maximum : A typical monotonic queue problem. 
>    * 862 Shortest Subarray with Sum at Least K : A monotonic queue problem. 
2. Dynamic Programming
>* Easy
>* Medium

3. Linked List
>* Medium
>    * 19 Remove Nth Node From End of List : Solve with only one pass.
4. Priority Queue
>* Hard
>    * 23 Merge k Sorted Lists : A typical heap problem. 
5. Tree
>* Medium
